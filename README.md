# PatchManager-v2
PowerShell script for deploying patches via a GUI interface.

This is a rewrite of the PatchManager script located here: https://github.com/smwerner19/PatchManager

This script was attempt to A) experiment with XAML and B) simplify the user interface. Unfortunately this script is incomplete. While it has a fully functional GUI, the deployment of patches does not currently function. Perhaps I'll find the time to go back and finish this one day.
